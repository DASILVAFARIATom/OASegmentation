## Abstract
It has been studied that retinal vessels are of the same embryonic nature as brain vessels [1]. Moreover, retinal micro-vascular system structural modifications correlated to ageing and hypertension have been observed [2].   
These alterations could be considered as cardio-vascular diseases markers. Vessel length, width or tortuosity might all be indicators of cardio-vascular health status of the patient.  
To measure these bio-markers, we need to segment the retina vessels.
